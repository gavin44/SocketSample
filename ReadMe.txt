Sockets provide a simple way to exchange data over the network
============================================================
About this program :

As sockets are based on client/server architecture, this application is composed of a server and a client. 
	The server will reserve a port number. 
	Then it will listen to any upcoming client. 
	The client then will attempt to connect to the server.
	When the connection succeeds, it will be possible to exchange text messages. 
	When finished, the connection will be closed.
